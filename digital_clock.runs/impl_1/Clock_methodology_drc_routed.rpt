LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell secondCounter/TensPlace/Q[3]_i_2__0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) secondCounter/OnesPlace/Q_reg[0]/CLR, secondCounter/OnesPlace/Q_reg[1]/CLR, secondCounter/OnesPlace/Q_reg[2]/CLR, secondCounter/OnesPlace/Q_reg[3]/CLR, secondCounter/TensPlace/Q_reg[0]/CLR, secondCounter/TensPlace/Q_reg[1]/CLR, secondCounter/TensPlace/Q_reg[2]/CLR, secondCounter/TensPlace/Q_reg[3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
